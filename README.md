# bi-customer-behavior
In this project, we are using the E-commerce Customer Behavior Dataset available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mkechinov/ecommerce-behavior-data-from-multi-category-store/data). This dataset includes anonymized customer behavior data from an online retail platform, detailing interactions such as page views, clicks, add-to-cart events, and purchases over a specific period.
