### Dataset Proposal: E-commerce Customer Behavior Dataset

#### 1. Choosing the Dataset

I propose using the E-commerce Customer Behavior Dataset available on Kaggle. This dataset includes anonymized customer behavior data from an online retail platform, detailing interactions such as page views, clicks, add-to-cart events, and purchases over a specific period.

#### 2. Context and KPIs

##### Context:
The goal of analyzing the E-commerce Customer Behavior Dataset is to understand customer behavior on the e-commerce platform, identify patterns in browsing and purchasing, and uncover insights that can help in improving user experience, increasing conversion rates, and optimizing marketing strategies.

##### Objectives:
1. **Customer Journey Analysis:** Understand the typical paths customers take from first visit to purchase.
2. **Conversion Rate Optimization:** Identify factors that contribute to higher conversion rates and reduce drop-offs.
3. **Product Performance:** Analyze which products are viewed, added to carts, and purchased the most.
4. **Marketing Effectiveness:** Assess the effectiveness of different marketing channels and campaigns.
5. **Customer Segmentation:** Segment customers based on their behavior to tailor marketing and product recommendations.

##### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
1. **Conversion Rate:** Percentage of users who make a purchase out of the total visitors.
2. **Average Session Duration:** Average time users spend on the platform.
3. **Bounce Rate:** Percentage of users who leave the platform after viewing only one page.
4. **Cart Abandonment Rate:** Percentage of users who add items to their cart but do not complete the purchase.
5. **Revenue per Visitor:** Average revenue generated per visitor.
6. **Product Views and Purchases:** Number of views and purchases for each product.
7. **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV):** Predicted revenue a customer will generate throughout their relationship with the platform.

#### 3. Data Cleaning and Preparation

##### Steps:
1. **Data Import:** Import the dataset into a suitable environment for analysis (e.g., Python, R, or Power BI).
2. **Handling Missing Values:** Identify and handle missing values, especially in critical fields like user ID and event type.
3. **Data Type Conversion:** Ensure all fields have the correct data types (e.g., dates, numeric values).
4. **Removing Duplicates:** Remove duplicate entries to ensure data accuracy.
5. **Filtering Data:** Filter out any irrelevant data, such as bot traffic or invalid sessions.
6. **Feature Engineering:** Create new features, such as session duration (time between first and last event), and user segments based on behavior (e.g., browsers, add-to-cart users, purchasers).

#### 4. Data Visualization

##### Visuals:
1. **Conversion Funnel:** Funnel chart showing the number of users at each stage (view, add to cart, purchase).
2. **Session Duration Distribution:** Histogram showing the distribution of session durations.
3. **Product Performance:** Bar chart showing the number of views and purchases for the top products.
4. **Traffic Sources:** Pie chart showing the distribution of traffic sources (e.g., organic search, paid search, direct).
5. **Customer Segmentation:** Scatter plot showing different customer segments based on their behavior metrics.

#### 5. Regression Analysis

##### Steps:
1. **Simple Linear Regression:** Analyze the relationship between session duration and likelihood of purchase.
2. **Multiple Linear Regression:** Explore the relationship between purchase probability (dependent variable) and multiple independent variables such as session duration, number of pages viewed, traffic source, and user demographics.

#### 6. Dashboard in Power BI

Create an interactive dashboard in Power BI that includes the following visuals:
1. **Conversion Funnel Chart**
2. **Session Duration Distribution Histogram**
3. **Product Performance Bar Chart**
4. **Traffic Sources Pie Chart**
5. **Customer Segmentation Scatter Plot**

Additionally, use Power BI to create other simple visuals like total revenue cards, filters for different time periods, and slicers for dynamic analysis.
