##  BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE PROJECT REQUIREMENTS

1. Choose a dataset you want to analyze from an online source or your working environment

2. Give context to dataset – explain what you want to measure and why would it be helpful for the business you’re doing the analysis for. Which KPIs would make sense to track? (0.5 – 1 page)


3. Clean and prepare data for analysis. Explain briefly each activity in this process.


4. Data Visualisation – create at least 5 visuals. It should be clear on each visual what it represents.


5. Simple and Multiple Linear Regression (or any other that makes more sense for your data)


6. Create a Dashboard in Power BI – you can display only visuals that you created in R, but you can also add other simple visuals created in Power BI (independent of R)
